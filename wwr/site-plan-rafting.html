    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>We are situated in a great location here at the confluence of the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers.
        Our goal as a company is to keep our customers informed as to conditions of the rapids we traverse 
        and promote the packages we offer to our target customer base.</p>
    <!-- change this -->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>As a company, our target audience is young adult men and women. We will focus our marketing at college and
        university campuses. Fitness Centers will also be targeted in our marketing campaigns. Typically, people
        who would be interested in rafting will be fit and interested in adventure and a little danger. This audience
        of younger adults will typically be using social media apps and so I believe our website focus should be on
        development of a company app.
